    question: "What are the foundation specifications for the main building?",
    answer:
      "The main building utilizes a reinforced concrete slab foundation with a minimum thickness of 150mm. The concrete mix is specified as C30/37 with water-resistant additives. Steel reinforcement consists of 12mm diameter rebar in a 200mm grid pattern. The foundation includes a 50mm blinding layer and a DPM (damp proof membrane) of 1200-gauge polythene. Foundation depth is 1.2m below ground level to ensure stability on the clay soil conditions. [Source: Foundation Design Document, Page: 12]",

    question: "What type of insulation is specified for the exterior walls?",
    answer:
      "Exterior walls feature a multi-layer insulation system consisting of 100mm rigid polyisocyanurate (PIR) boards with a thermal conductivity of 0.022 W/mK, providing a U-value of 0.18 W/m²K. The insulation is installed between the external brick cladding and the internal concrete block wall with a 50mm cavity. All joints are sealed with aluminum tape to prevent thermal bridging. The system exceeds the minimum requirements specified in Building Regulations Part L. [Source: Wall Construction Specifications, Page: 24]",

    question: "Does the electrical system comply with current safety regulations?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the electrical system complies with the 18th Edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations (BS 7671:2018+A1:2020). The system includes RCD protection for all circuits, with 30mA trip sensitivity for socket outlets and 100mA for lighting circuits. All consumer units feature metal enclosures with surge protection devices (SPDs). The installation requires certification by a qualified electrician registered with a competent person scheme such as NICEIC or ELECSA, with test results documented in an Electrical Installation Certificate (EIC).

    question: "What are the fire safety provisions for the building?",
    answer:
      "The building incorporates a comprehensive fire safety system in compliance with Building Regulations Part B. This includes fire-resistant compartmentation with 60-minute fire-rated walls and floors between different usage areas. Fire doors with 30-minute resistance (FD30) are installed at strategic locations. The automatic fire detection system consists of optical smoke detectors in corridors and heat detectors in kitchens, connected to a central addressable control panel. Sprinkler systems are installed throughout with a water flow rate of 2.25 mm/min as per BS EN 12845. Emergency lighting provides 3-hour backup and illuminates all escape routes.

    question: "What are the specifications for the roof structure?",
    answer:
      "The roof structure consists of prefabricated timber trusses at 600mm centers, designed to support a total load of 1.5 kN/m² including snow loading. Trusses are manufactured from C24 grade timber with galvanized steel connector plates. The roof covering comprises concrete interlocking tiles with a minimum pitch of 22.5°. Ventilation is provided by 25mm continuous eaves vents and ridge vents, delivering an airflow equivalent to 5000mm²/m. The roof includes a breathable membrane underlay with a vapor resistance of less than 0.25 MNs/g. [Source: Roof Construction Details, Page: 7]",

    question: "What are the drainage specifications for the site?",
    answer:
      "The site drainage system utilizes a sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) approach. Surface water is managed through permeable paving in parking areas and bioretention swales along the perimeter. Rainwater from roof areas is collected in 5000L underground storage tanks for landscape irrigation. Foul drainage consists of 110mm diameter PVC pipes with a minimum fall of 1:40, connecting to inspection chambers at maximum 45m intervals. The system connects to the public sewer at the northwest corner of the site via a 150mm diameter connection with an anti-flood valve. All drainage complies with Building Regulations Part H and has been approved by the local water authority. [Source: Drainage Design Document, Page: 18]",

    question: "What are the ventilation requirements for the building?",
    answer:
      "The building employs a mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) system providing whole-house ventilation. The system delivers 0.5 air changes per hour under normal conditions, increasing to 4 air changes per hour in kitchens and bathrooms during peak usage. The MVHR unit has a heat recovery efficiency of 90% and specific fan power less than 0.7 W/(l/s). Fresh air is supplied to all habitable rooms while extract is taken from wet rooms. The system includes G4 filters for incoming air and incorporates summer bypass functionality. All ductwork is rigid spiral-wound galvanized steel with a maximum air velocity of 3m/s to minimize noise. The system complies with Building Regulations Part F and has been commissioned to deliver the designed airflow rates. [Source: Ventilation System Specifications, Page: 31]",
